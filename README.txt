This is the public facing side of the scheduling project for Lowell Observatory's Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT).

There are two reasons for this project's existence:
- to host the static html observing schedule web pages at:  http://lowell-dct.github.io
- to allow savvy users to access the past history of schedule changes as needed by going to:  https://github.com/Lowell-DCT/Lowell-DCT.github.io

Questions/comments can be directed to:  tac@lowell.edu
